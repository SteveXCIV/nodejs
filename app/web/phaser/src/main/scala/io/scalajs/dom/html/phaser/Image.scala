/**
  * An Image is a light-weight object you can use to display anything that doesn't need physics or animation.
  * It can still rotate, scale, crop and receive input events. This makes it perfect for logos, backgrounds, simple
  * buttons and other non-Sprite graphics.
  * @param game  A reference to the currently running game.
  * @param x     The x coordinate of the Image. The coordinate is relative to any parent container this Image may be in.
  * @param y     The y coordinate of the Image. The coordinate is relative to any parent container this Image may be in.
  * @param key   The texture used by the Image during rendering. It can be a string which is a reference to the Cache
  *              entry, or an instance of a RenderTexture, BitmapData or PIXI.Texture.
  * @param frame If this Image is using part of a sprite sheet or texture atlas you can specify the exact frame to use
  *              by giving a string or numeric index.
  * @see http://phaser.io/docs/2.6.2/Phaser.Image.html

    * Values from 0 to 180 represent clockwise rotation; values from 0 to -180 represent counterclockwise rotation.
    *
    * Values outside this range are added to or subtracted from 360 to obtain a value within the range.
    * For example, the statement player.angle = 450 is the same as player.angle = 90.
    *
    * If you wish to work in radians instead of degrees you can use the property rotation instead.
    * Working in radians is slightly faster as it doesn't have to perform any calculations.
