/**
  * A Graphics object is a way to draw primitives to your game. Primitives include forms of geometry, such as Rectangles,
  * Circles and Polygons. They also include lines, arcs and curves. When you initially create a Graphics object it will
  * be empty. To 'draw' to it you first specify a lineStyle or fillStyle (or both), and then draw a shape.
  * @param game Current game instance.
  * @param x    X-position of the new graphics object.
  * @param y    Y-position of the new graphics object.
  * @see http://phaser.io/docs/2.6.2/Phaser.Graphics.html

    * The angle property is the rotation of the Game Object in degrees from its original orientation.

    * Values from 0 to 180 represent clockwise rotation; values from 0 to -180 represent counterclockwise rotation.
    *
    * Values outside this range are added to or subtracted from 360 to obtain a value within the range.
    * For example, the statement player.angle = 450 is the same as player.angle = 90.
    *
    * If you wish to work in radians instead of degrees you can use the property rotation instead.
    * Working in radians is slightly faster as it doesn't have to perform any calculations.
